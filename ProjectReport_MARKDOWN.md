Acknowledgments

**1 Introduction**

At the beginning of the year we were tasked with creating a team. The
idea behind us coming together was to understand how a group of people
would work together in the real world. Being in a team would involve
interactons in dividing jobs and group communication.

As a team we were given multiple options for project subjects. Our team
chose the development of a party style multiplayer video game. As we all
have a heavy interest in computer games in general, it was the perfect
choice for us.

**Situation Analysis**

As the party style multiplayer video game was our choice, this is what
we researched. The first study was into different examples of what type
of game a party style multiplayer video game is. This gave us a clear
picture of what the end product was to be.

When we had a clear picture of what type of game we wanted, we put
together some graphic design ideas of the menus levels and characters.
We came up with general objectives per level and how the scoring systems
would work per level and over all.

We had decided from the beggining to use Unity to help us develop the
project since we all had a decent amount of experience with this
environment. In Unity our code of choice is C\#.

Design

Our idea is an easy to adapt to, multiplayer, party style game.
Something anybody, from a low experience level to high in gaming would
easily be able to pick up and play. The design is based around straight
forward controlls and basic objectives. The chalenge is mainly focused
on winning against each other, rather then winning the level. This sort
of game should build an exstatic energy, perfect in a party environment.
The look and feel of the game is a minimal simplistic feel. We didnt
want anything with too high of a detail considering its nature. The
assets for the game were all downloaded for free from a very helpfull
website www.gameart2d.com.

Prototype

When we had a clear idea of our projects requirements we got to work on
our prototype. One of the memebers designed and built the menu system,
while the other two members and I, built a level each. Using the sprites
we had downloaded, we were able to build, quite nice looking levels,
with interesting charaters. We also put the animations together ourselfs
for the characters from the sprite sheets. Implementing music and a
basic points system, we had 3 levels and a menu system as our prototype.

Evaluation of Prototype and Full working system

The prototype was basic, and needed alot of polishing for what it was.
There were also 3 more levels to be added. It was a simple display of
how the mechanics of the game would work and how it would look and feel.

We gave the prototype to friends and family and got some great feedback,
even considering it wasnt anywhere close to being finished. With the
feedback we were able to imporve certain aspects of the game.

Our points system was unclear at the prototype stage, so we were to
improve on a better system per level. A better UI was implemented with
basic graphics that represented player statistics and lives.

Music was to be added to one of the levels for improved atmospheric
feeling.

 We had talked about and designed a tournement quickfire option, that
was to be implemented when we had everything else done.

Have a menu system between games with score board with the results of
the level, who won, whos go is it next etc.

We also wanted to implement xbox or playstation controllers if we had
the time.

To complete the system we wanted full working animations on all
characters.

General Computer Science knowledge

This subject rquired us to have knowledge in computer programming as
well games design and experience in Unity. As we all have experience in
Unity from previous projects from over the years of college it was
perfect for us. As computer science student we are constanlty coding in
different languages so the coding wasnt to much of a problem. This
project required us to have this experince before we could start.

**2 System Analysis and Design**

As this project is a game i will explain in terms of "scenes". The first
scene is the main menu where the games first loads too. There are 3
options, Quick Match, Tournament, and Exit. The quick match option will
allow you and a friend to play a level of your choosing. The Tournament
option will allow you to play all 6 levels with a final score and who
won. During each of the levels there is a UI to display player statistic
and timer depending on objectives.

Each leve has a different objectives and different dangers. Some are
object that can damage or reduce the players health, others are a timer
against the players.

Quick Match

Going form quick match, you will be brought into another menu where you
pick the level you want to play. Once finished the level, you will be
brought to another scene with your score, and who was the winner. From
there you will be given the option to replay the level or return to main
meun.

Tournament

In the tournament option, you will be brought to a menu to declare who
is player one and player 2. The game will start off on the first level.
When finished, you will be brought to another scene where it will show
you your score and who won. You will then continue on to the next level
and so on until you have completed all levels. When you have finished
all of the levels you will be brought to another scene where it will
tell you the score of each round and the winner of the tournament.

Exit

The exit option is exits the system to your desktop.

**User Interface Design**

In one of the levels there is a very basic user interface. You can see
in the top right and left corners there is Player 1 and Player 2. Each
of the candy canes represents a life of the character. When a player
loses all their lifes the other player wins. Each time the player is hit
with the opponents snow ball the a candy cane is removed from the UI.

****

This is the class for managing this scene. It determines, if a player
has no lifes it will load the next scene.

public class SnowBallManager {

if (P1Life &lt;= 0){

 player1.SetActive(false);

 P1Wins.SetActive(true);

if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Return)){

SceneManager.LoadScene(nextScene);

}

if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Escape)){

SceneManager.LoadScene(mainMenu);

}}

if (P2Life &lt;= 0){

if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Return)){

SceneManager.LoadScene(nextScene);

}

if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Escape)){

SceneManager.LoadScene(mainMenu);

}

}

public void HurtP1(){

P1Life -= 1;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; P1Sticks.Length; i++){

if (P1Life &gt; i){

 P1Sticks\[i\].SetActive(true);

}else{

 P1Sticks\[i\].SetActive(false);

}}

hurtSound.Play();

}

public void HurtP2(){

P2Life -= 1;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; P2Sticks.Length; i++){

if (P2Life &gt; i){

 P2Sticks\[i\].SetActive(true);

}else{

P2Sticks\[i\].SetActive(false);

}}

2.5 Data Design

We have yet to implement our data storage.

3 Implementation of system

After doing research on the topic we took notes for specifications of
the game. In one of the early meetings we drew out a list of features
that were to be in the game. After getting our complete list together we
drew up a rough draft on what type of code we need.

My two levels were to have a games manager to keep the overall
organisation of the game in one script. Through this, the features would
be added as nessecary. For example changing scenes would be managed
through this script.

The player controlls and animations are controlled through a
player1controll script. Each input button can be mapped to anywhere on
the keyboard. Each time the button pressed the specific animation for
that specific direction or movement is played.

We used alot of Unity's features to help go towards our original design
ideas. One thing we didnt actuly plan in the design was the animations.
Unity was a great help for that. We were able to take a sprite sheet,
"slice" it into different pictures and build a moving animation from it.

4 Testing and evaluation

The has been no white box test yet, but we plan to do testing later on
when we get other more important tasks done.

5 Conclusions and Further Work

Conclusions to be made after being fully tested .

There are an endless amount of other features i would have put in the
game if i had more time. One of them would be to have it on the
internet. To have a two player game like this that you could play with a
friend across the globe would have been great. Considering the leight
weight of it, it would have been easy to do. Having a website for high
scores and chat rooms to talk to friends. Or uploading it as a facebook
2 player game.

More levels , more features, booster during the levels, extra lives.
Having bigger levels with more then 2 players. 3D levels, the list
endless.
